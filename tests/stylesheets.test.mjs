// --- !important does not creep ----------------------------------------------
//
// stylelint's declaration-no-important is switched off in stylelint.config.mjs,
// and this replaces it. An override theme genuinely needs !important: it is the
// only thing that outranks the inline styles ruTorrent writes. The useful
// signal is not the count but the count *growing*, where a warning per use is
// just a wall to skim past.
//
// A ratchet, not a limit. Lower these when a use is removed; raising one takes
// an argument in the commit message.

	// Seven of these are the file-type icons, and they lose without it for the
	// reason the three beside them already do: `.stable-icon` clears the
	// background-image from a later sheet at the same specificity, so a plain
	// class never paints. The size travels inside the `background` shorthand
	// for the same reason — the shorthand resets `background-size`, and an
	// important reset outranks a separate declaration after it.
	"style.css": 42,
	"stable.css": 2,
	// Two. The second is check_port's hidden segments: the plugin empties one and
	// calls jQuery's `.hide()`, writing a plain inline `display: none`, while the
	// same elements carry Bootstrap's `d-lg-block` — `display: block !important`.
	// An important declaration outranks an inline one that is not, so a hidden
	// separator stays in the flow with its inline `margin: 0 3px`. Only
	// !important outranks !important.
	"plugins.css": 2,
	// Three. Two are Bootstrap's rather than the plugin's and sit in one rule:
	// being last of the three sheets outranks every rule the plugin writes, but
	// not a utility class that carries !important on its own declarations. See
	// the filter count's pill, where the utility forces both of them.
	//
	// The third is the icon font. `plugins/mobile/mobile.css:9` sets the family
	// on `.bi:before` with !important, and an emptied `content` does not release
	// it — the pseudo-element still lays out and the browser still fetches
	// 134,044 bytes for its metrics.
	"mobile.css": 3,
	// Four, all the same fight: `.stable-body td div` in ruTorrent below 5.2.0
	// pins every cell's box with `height: 16px !important` and
	// `margin: 0 2px !important`. The cell clips at `overflow: hidden`, so the
	// height cuts a descender off, and the margin stands the row's text 1.5px
	// left of the reference. Only !important outranks !important. Every value
	// is the reference's own — 19px for an ordinary cell, 22px for the name,
	// 16px for the progress bar, 3.5px of margin on each side.

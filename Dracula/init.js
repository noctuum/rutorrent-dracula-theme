/*
 * Dracula Theme for ruTorrent — behaviour
 * Version 0.2.1 · built against ruTorrent 5.3   # x-release-please-version
 * https://draculatheme.com
 *
 * Checks at startup that the stylesheets beside it carry the same version — see
 * draculaCheckVersions. This file cannot be served stale: ruTorrent inlines it
 * into a PHP response (`plugins/theme/init.php:22`) while the sheets sit behind
 * a cached URL.
 *
 * Carries every behavioural change the theme makes: keyboard handling, the
 * status classification, dialog geometry, the context menu, the status bar, the
 * favicon and the graph colours.
 *
 * ruTorrent appends this file to its own script bundle, so everything below
 * runs against globals the WebUI has already defined. The block below declares
 * them so a linter reading the file on its own does not report every use as an
 * undefined variable, and so a reader can see what the theme depends on.

/* === Graphs stay sharp when the page is zoomed === */

/* Two different zooms, needing different handling.

   Ctrl+= is full page zoom: the browser changes devicePixelRatio, re-lays the
   page out in CSS pixels and re-evaluates media queries. A pinch on a touchpad
   or touchscreen is visual-viewport zoom and does none of that — it magnifies
   the composited output like a lens. At a pinch of 3, devicePixelRatio stays 1,
   visualViewport.scale goes to 3 and the CSS box is unchanged.

   The compositor re-rasterises text and SVG at the new scale, which is why
   everything else stays sharp. A canvas is a bitmap and cannot. So the
   effective density a canvas has to match is devicePixelRatio times the visual
   scale, not devicePixelRatio alone. */
function draculaVisualScale()

	var viewport = window.visualViewport;
	return (viewport && viewport.scale) || 1;
}

/* How far a given canvas may be scaled up before the allocation stops being
   reasonable. Budgeted by area, not by a flat ceiling: a flat ceiling throttles
   a 100x20 status-bar meter as hard as a full-tab graph, though the meter at
   ten times over is still only 200,000 pixels. Chrome reaches devicePixelRatio
   5 at maximum zoom and a pinch multiplies on top of that, so a ceiling of 4
   leaves the meter five times too small with both at maximum.

   The side limit keeps every dimension inside what engines will allocate at
   all; past that a canvas fails and draws nothing, which is worse than soft. */
function draculaRatioLimit(width, height)
{
	var maxPixels = 8000000;
	var maxSide = 8192;

	var w = Math.max(1, width);
	var h = Math.max(1, height);

	var byArea = Math.sqrt(maxPixels / (w * h));

}

/* Without this, every flot graph in the product — the CPU meter, Speed, Trafic
   — turns soft the moment the page is zoomed and stays soft. Two lines of flot
   0.8.3 explain it.

   Its Canvas constructor reads the ratio exactly once:

       i = window.devicePixelRatio || 1;
       this.pixelRatio = i / backingStoreRatio;

   and resize() early-outs when the CSS size has not changed:

       if (this.width  != t) { i.width  = t * n; i.style.width  = t + "px"; ... }
       if (this.height != e) { i.height = e * n; i.style.height = e + "px"; ... }

   Zooming changes devicePixelRatio but not the size in CSS pixels, so the
   guards never fire, the backing store keeps the ratio it was born with, and
   the browser scales the bitmap up to fill the box. Redrawing cannot clear
   that: every later draw goes into the same undersized buffer, and
   plot.resize() compares the same unchanged dimensions.

   flot never exports Canvas, but hands the class to plugin init() as
   `classes.Canvas`, which is the one way to reach it. Refreshing pixelRatio
   there and clearing the cached dimensions makes the original resize() rebuild
   the buffer at the new ratio. Registered at module scope on purpose: the theme
   declares runlevel 5 and loads ahead of the plugins that draw graphs, so
   init() is still called for their plots; inside allDone it would be too late
   for the CPU graph.

   The patch alone is not enough: a density change fires **no** window resize
   event, so nothing calls resize(). Both watchers below exist for that, one per
   kind of zoom. */

   Pink to Purple, so an idle meter is light and a full one deep, and every
   value between stays inside one palette family rather than passing through the
   muddy tones a green-to-red ramp gives at 50%.

   The repaint is not decoration: this runs from allDone, by which time the
   meter has drawn itself once with upstream's colours and would keep them until

// ruTorrent refuses keyboard focus on much of its own chrome:
// `addButtonToToolbar` binds `focus: (ev) => ev.target.blur()` to every toolbar
// button (plugins.js:364), and `attachPageToTabs` does the same to every
// plugin-added detail tab (plugins.js:271). The effect is that the toolbar and
// four of the eleven detail tabs cannot be reached from a keyboard at all, and
// no stylesheet can mark focus on an element that never holds it.
//
// It is done two ways, and both have to be undone:
//   - the core toolbar buttons carry an inline `onfocus="this.blur()"`
//     attribute in index.html, which no amount of jQuery `off()` can reach;
//   - everything added later binds a jQuery handler instead.
//
// `off("focus")` clears every jQuery focus handler on these elements, which is
// safe because the blur is the only one any of them carries in 5.3.7.
// Context-menu commands (objects.js:389, :409) do the same thing but are
// rebuilt on each open, so they are handled by draculaPrepareMenuLevel.

}

// The keyboard model: five regions — toolbar, sidebar, torrent list, detail
// panel, status bar — where Tab moves between regions and the arrows move
// inside one. This function is the mechanism every region is wired to.
//
// Unaided, 5.3.7 offers 26 tab stops and 25 of them are two rows — 14 toolbar
// controls and 11 detail tabs — so Tab never leaves the first row. A roving
// tabindex is the standard answer: exactly one control in a region is tabbable,
// and an arrow key moves both the focus and that single stop.
//
// The pattern bends around two controls, and the rule is the same for both — a
// control keeps the axis it needs and gives up the other:
//   - a text field owns Left/Right, which move its caret, so the row moves on
//     Up/Down instead;
//   - a <select> owns Up/Down, which change its value, so it moves on
//     Left/Right. Space and Enter still open it, and inside the open list the
//     browser's own Up/Down pick an option.
// Neither control becomes unreachable and neither loses a key it needs.

// Arrow order follows what is on screen, not what is in the markup. The two
// differ in the toolbar by this theme's doing: the three-zone layout moves the
// search and settings groups past each other with flex `order`, so the DOM runs
// …Stop, RSS, Settings, Plugins, Help, Search, field, Go while the eye reads
// …Stop, Search, field, Go, RSS, Settings, Plugins, Help.
//
// Items are grouped into visual rows by their vertical centre and sorted left
// to right within a row, which reads correctly for a horizontal bar, for the
// vertical sidebar, and for a toolbar wrapped onto two lines. Bucketing rather
// than comparing centres pairwise keeps the comparator transitive.

// The letterform is upstream's own, traced from images/favicon-196x196.png:
// same stem with its flared base, same top flag, same round shoulder on a thin
// neck. Tracing the raster directly follows its antialiasing and gives a lumpy

// Two colours, both read from the palette rather than written here, which is the
// point of doing it this way: a re-themed copy of this folder changes its custom
// properties and the tab icon follows, with no JavaScript to edit.

// (`webui.js:280`), Ctrl-O is Add Torrent, Ctrl-F is search, and Ctrl-S, Ctrl-R
// and Ctrl-T are the browser's — the mnemonic letters are exactly the
// unavailable ones. Unmodified they are free, every letter case in upstream's

//
// This is the shape Delete has — live everywhere, held off while you type —
// which `stable.js:812` guards with `!e.fromTextCtrl` and
// `!theDialogManager.isModalState()`. `fromTextCtrl` is jQuery's, added by the
// patched `$.event.fix` at `common.js:81` for `input`, `textarea` and `a`; a
// native listener never sees it, so the test is written out in
// draculaTypingInto.
//

// because these keys are *letters*. Delete does nothing in a `<select>`, but `s`
// jumps it to the first option starting with s — and would start the torrents
// at the same time.

   A browser fetches a face when a rendered element resolves to it, and on a

   panel's `font-family`, and both are live until the mobile plugin disables the
   theme (`plugins/mobile/init.js:2138`). The panel is the only element reading
   --font-mono that is rendered by then — the console, the chunk map and the URL
   textarea sit in dialogs nothing has opened — and it is enough to pull 31,432
   bytes of a latin subset that interface never draws.

   Nothing readable at the moment this file runs says which interface is coming.
   `jQuery.browser.mobile` is the mobile plugin's own
   (`plugins/mobile/init.js:2666`) and does not exist yet, and every plugin is
   evaluated inside one synchronous pass over `getplugins.php`, which no
   observer or microtask of this file interleaves with. A timer runs after that
   pass, where the answer is settled.

   on the page. `plugins.css` is the one the mobile interface still needs, and
   upstream puts it back only once `theWebUI.config` runs — measured, gone at
   633ms and back at 1076ms, with the interface drawn and on screen in
   Bootstrap's colours for the 443ms between.

   It goes back the moment it goes, by re-appending the node rather than asking
   for a fresh one. Once only: a sheet removed a second time is a theme being
   switched off for good, and answering that would loop.

   `injectCSS` (`js/plugins.js:24`) appends a new <link> on every call and never
   looks for one already there, which is what puts this sheet on the page twice.
   Holding it at a single copy is what keeps the restore from becoming a third,
   and the copy kept is the newest, so which sheet wins does not change — it
   still sits after every plugin sheet.

   An older copy goes only once the newer one has applied. A <link> styles
   nothing until its sheet arrives, so dropping the working copy at the moment
   the replacement is appended leaves the page with none of these rules for as
   long as the fetch takes, and the mobile interface pays for that gap in a
   webfont: `plugins/mobile/mobile.css:9` puts the icon family on `.bi:before`,
   and with the theme's own rule missing the browser fetches 134,044 bytes for
   metrics behind a glyph it never draws. `sheet` is non-null exactly when a
